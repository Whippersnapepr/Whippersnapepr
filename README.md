### My name is Andrew Bennett, I am a Game Dev student. I plan on becoming a teacher in the future, so game dev will most likely forever just be my passion work. I do love the creative process, I love(d, at one point) coding, and animation. Blender is my main creative outlet, because I know how to do things on there. If I had more time and energy, I'm sure I would pursue a career in Game Dev along with my teaching somehow. My favorite games are Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, BOTW, Inscryption, and a lot of others that I cant remember, but I know I love. I want to know C#, maybeeeee some others like python.
